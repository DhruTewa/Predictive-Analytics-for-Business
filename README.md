# Predictive-Analytics-for-Business
This repository has the predictive analytics projects I completed as a part of Udacity's [Predictive Analytics for Business Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analyst-nanodegree--nd008).

### Part 1: [Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics by Alteryx]
Learn a structured framework for solving problems with advanced analytics. Learn to select the most appropriate analytical methodology. Learn linear regression.
- Project: [Predicting Catalog Demand](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/1-%20Problem%20Solving%20with%20Analytics/Predicting%20Catalog%20Demand%20Project%20.ipynb)

### Part 2: [Creating an Analytical Dataset by Alteryx]
Understand the most common data types. Understand the various sources of data. Make adjustments to dirty data to prepare a dataset. Identify and adjust for outliers. 
- Project: [Data Cleanup](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/2-%20Data%20Wrangling/Creating%20An%20Analytical%20Dataset.ipynb)

### Part 4: [Classification Models by Alteryx]
You will use classification models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, forest, and boosted, to make predictions of binary and non-binary outcomes.

- Project: [Predicting Default Risk](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/3-%20Classification%20Model/Predicting%20Default%20Risk.ipynb)

### Part 5: [A/B Testing]
Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing, including experimental design, variable selection, and analyzing and interpreting results.

- Project: [A/B Test a New Menu Launch](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/4-AB%20Testing-%20New%20Product%20Launch/AB%20Testing%20-%20New%20Menu%20Launched.ipynb)

### Part 6: [Time Series Forecasting]
Understand trend, seasonal, and cyclical behavior of time series data. Use time series decomposition plots. Build ETS and ARIMA models.

- Project: [Forecast Video Game Sales](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/5-Forecasting%20VIdeo%20Games%20Sales/Forecasting%20Video%20Games%20Sales.ipynb)

### Part 7: [Segmentation and Clustering]
Understand the difference between localization, standardization, and segmentation. Scale data to prepare a dataset for cluster modeling. Use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of variables for cluster model. Build and apply a k-centroid cluster model. Visualize and communicate the results of a cluster model.
Then complete a capstone project combining techniques learned throughout the program.

- Project: [Predictive Analytics Capstone](https://github.com/DhruTewa/Predictive-Analytics-for-Business/blob/master/6-%20Segmentation%20and%20Clustering/Capstone%20Project.ipynb)
